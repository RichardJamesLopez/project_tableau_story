<h2>
  Summary:
</h2>
  <p>
    This Tableau story visualizes the available market data available for the Cryptoasset AirSwap Token. AST is a relatively new Cryptoasset, but it does have price dynamics that were worth looking into.
  </p>
<h2>
  Design:
</h2>
  <p>
    The story lays out 4 core themes that can be gleamed from vanilla pricing data.
    <li> Price
    <li> Market Cap
    <li> Volatility
    <li> Spread
    </li>
    <br>
    These themes are conceptually very similarly, and so there was a need to use different chart types for themes. For example, the Volatility and Spread are depicted by Scatterplots and Heat Maps respectively. Also, they have different time intervals (months vs. weeks) to differentiate the message and slides.

<h2>
  Feedback:
</h2>
  <p>
    The feedback I received was to rethink the color scheme. The comment was laid out as such:
  </p>
  <p>
    <li> "I can't gather why some months are red and another green from looking at your Volatility slide"
  </p>

  <p>
     Originally, the Volatility slide (Dashboard 3) had a shared color scheme with the other slides (Red to Green spectrum). This uniform color scheme generally makes sense as it relates to negative to positive performance. However, for the Volatility slide, the colors were differentiated by time as opposed to performance. It was confusing for the viewer to see red and green by month as they thought it had to do with positive vs. negative performing months. I changed this to a blue spectrum color scheme for the 2nd version of this Tableau Story.
